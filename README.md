⚡️ Official library to annotate, manage datasets, and models on
[V7's Darwin Training Data Platform](https://darwin.v7labs.com). ⚡️

Need to label data? [**Start using V7 free today**](https://www.v7labs.com/get-started)

Darwin-py can both be used from the [command line](#usage-as-a-command-line-interface-cli) and as a [python library](#usage-as-a-python-library).

<hr/>

Main functions are (but not limited to):

- Client authentication
- Listing local and remote datasets
- Create/remove datasets
- Upload/download data to/from remote datasets
- Direct integration with PyTorch dataloaders

Support tested for python 3.8 - 3.10

##  🏁 Installation

```
pip install darwin-py
```

You can now type `darwin` in your terminal and access the command line interface.

If you wish to use the PyTorch bindings, then you can use the `ml` flag to install all the additional requirements

```
pip install darwin-py[ml]
```

If you wish to use video frame extraction, then you can use the `ocv` flag to install all the additional requirements

```
pip install darwin-py[ocv]
```

To run test, first install the `test` extra package

```
pip install darwin-py[test]
```
### Development

See our development and QA environment installation recommendations [here](docs/DEV.md)

## Usage as a Command Line Interface (CLI)

Once installed, `darwin` is accessible as a command line tool.
A useful way to navigate the CLI usage is through the help command `-h/--help` which will
provide additional information for each command available.

### Client Authentication

To perform remote operations on Darwin you first need to authenticate.
This requires a [team-specific API-key](https://darwin.v7labs.com/?settings=api-keys).
If you do not already have a Darwin account, you can [contact us](https://www.v7labs.com/contact) and we can set one up for you.

To start the authentication process:

```
$ darwin authenticate
API key:
Make example-team the default team? [y/N] y
Datasets directory [~/.darwin/datasets]:
Authentication succeeded.
```

You will be then prompted to enter your API-key, whether you want to set the corresponding team as
default and finally the desired location on the local file system for the datasets of that team.
This process will create a configuration file at `~/.darwin/config.yaml`.
This file will be updated with future authentications for different teams.

### Listing local and remote datasets

Lists a summary of local existing datasets

```
$ darwin dataset local
NAME            IMAGES     SYNC_DATE         SIZE
mydataset       112025     yesterday     159.2 GB
```

Lists a summary of remote datasets accessible by the current user.

```
$ darwin dataset remote
NAME                       IMAGES     PROGRESS
example-team/mydataset     112025        73.0%
```

### Create/remove a dataset

To create an empty dataset remotely:

```
$ darwin dataset create test
Dataset 'test' (example-team/test) has been created.
Access at https://darwin.v7labs.com/datasets/579
```

The dataset will be created in the team you're authenticated for.

To delete the project on the server:

```
$ darwin dataset remove test
About to delete example-team/test on darwin.
Do you want to continue? [y/N] y
```

### Upload/download data to/from a remote dataset

Uploads data to an existing remote project.
It takes the dataset name and a single image (or directory) with images/videos to upload as
parameters.

The `-e/--exclude` argument allows to indicate file extension/s to be ignored from the data_dir.
e.g.: `-e .jpg`

For videos, the frame rate extraction rate can be specified by adding `--fps <frame_rate>`

Supported extensions:

- Video files: [`.mp4`, `.bpm`, `.mov` formats].
- Image files [`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` formats].

```
$ darwin dataset push test /path/to/folder/with/images
100%|████████████████████████| 2/2 [00:01<00:00,  1.27it/s]
```

Before a dataset can be downloaded, a release needs to be generated:

```
$ darwin dataset export test 0.1
Dataset test successfully exported to example-team/test:0.1
```

This version is immutable, if new images / annotations have been added you will have to create a new release to included them.

To list all available releases

```
$ darwin dataset releases test
NAME                           IMAGES     CLASSES                   EXPORT_DATE
example-team/test:0.1               4           0     2019-12-07 11:37:35+00:00
```

And to finally download a release.

```
$ darwin dataset pull test:0.1
Dataset example-team/test:0.1 downloaded at /directory/choosen/at/authentication/time .
```

## Usage as a Python library

The framework is designed to be usable as a standalone python library.
Usage can be inferred from looking at the operations performed in `darwin/cli_functions.py`.
A minimal example to download a dataset is provided below and a more extensive one can be found in

[./darwin_demo.py](https://github.com/v7labs/darwin-py/blob/master/darwin_demo.py).


```python
from darwin.client import Client

client = Client.local() # use the configuration in ~/.darwin/config.yaml
dataset = client.get_remote_dataset("example-team/test")
dataset.pull() # downloads annotations and images for the latest exported version
```

Follow [this guide](https://docs.v7labs.com/docs/loading-a-dataset-in-python) for how to integrate darwin datasets directly in PyTorch.
