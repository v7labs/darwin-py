Description: # Darwin
        Official library to manage datasets along with v7 Darwin annotation platform [https://darwin.v7labs.com](https://darwin.v7labs.com).
        
        Support tested for python3.7.
        
        ## Installation
        
        ### Standard
        
        ```
        pip install darwin-py
        ```
        You can now type `darwin` in your terminal and access the command line interface.
        
        ### Development
        After cloning the repository:
        
        ```
        pip install --editable .
        ```
        
        ## Usage
        
        Darwin can be used as a python library or as a command line tool.
        Main functions are:
        
        - Client authentication
        - Listing local and remote datasets
        - Create/remove a dataset 
        - Upload/download data to/from a remote dataset
        
        ---
        
        ### As a library
        
        Darwin can be used as a python library.
        
        #### Client Authentication 
        To access darwin you first need to authenticate, this can be done once by creating a configuration 
        file, or every time by providing credentials at the login.
        
        To create the configuration file first authenticate without ~/.darwin/config.yaml file 
        (which can also be generated with the CLI):
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.login(email="simon@v7labs.com", password="*********")
        ```
        
        Then, persist the configuration file with:
        
        ```python
        from darwin.utils import make_configuration_file
        
        make_configuration_file(client)   
        ```
        
        Afterwards, calling the creation of Client with default parameters will load the configurations
        previously saved:
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.default()
        ```
        
        
        #### Listing local and remote datasets
        
        Print a list of local existing projects
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.default()
        for p in client.list_local_datasets():
            print(p.name)
        ```
        
        Print a list of remote projects accessible by the current user.
        Note: the list will include only those datasets which belong in the team where the user is currently 
        authenticated. 
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.default()
        for dataset in client.list_remote_datasets():
            print(dataset.slug, dataset.image_count)
        ```
        
        
        #### Create/remove a dataset 
        
        Dataset creation is handled by the client:
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.default()
        client.create_dataset(name="This Is My New Dataset")
        ```
        
        Whereas dataset removal is handled directly by the dataset itself:
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.default()
        dataset = client.get_remote_dataset(slug="this-is-my-new-dataset")
        dataset.remove_remote()
        ```
        
        
        #### Upload/download data to/from a remote dataset
        
        To upload data to an existing remote project there are several solutions.
        A simple one is to update the local folder where the dataset is located and then upload the
        files to the remote dataset. 
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.default()
        dataset = client.get_remote_dataset(slug="example-dataset")
        progress = dataset.push()
        ```
        
        To download a remote project, images and annotations, in the projects directory 
        (specified in the authentication process [default: ~/.darwin/projects]).
        
        ```python
        from darwin.client import Client
        
        client = Client.default()
        dataset = client.get_remote_dataset(slug="example-dataset")
        dataset.pull()
        ```
        
        
        ---
        
        ### Command line
        
        `darwin` is also accessible as a command line tool.
        
        
        #### Client Authentication 
        
        A username (email address) and password is required to authenticate. 
        If you do not already have a Darwin account, register for free at [https://darwin.v7labs.com](https://darwin.v7labs.com).
        ```
        $ darwin authenticate
        Username (email address): simon@v7labs.com
        Password: *******
        Project directory [~/.darwin/projects]: 
        Projects directory created /Users/simon/.darwin/projects
        Authentication succeeded.
        ```
        
        
        #### Listing local and remote datasets 
        
        Lists a summary of local existing projects
        ```
        $ darwin local
        NAME                IMAGES     SYNC DATE          SIZE
        example-project          3         today      800.2 kB
        ```
        
        Lists a summary of remote projects accessible by the current user.
        
        ```
        $ darwin remote
        NAME                 IMAGES     PROGRESS     ID
        example-project           3         0.0%     89
        ```
        
        
        #### Create/remove a dataset 
        
        Creates an empty dataset remotely.
        
        ```
        $ darwin create example-dataset
        Dataset 'example-project' has been created.
        Access at https://darwin.v7labs.com/datasets/example-project
        ``` 
        
        To delete the project on the server add the `-r` /`--remote` flag
        ```
        $ darwin remove example-project --remote
        About to deleting example-project on darwin.
        Do you want to continue? [y/N] y
        ```
        
        
        #### Upload/download data to/from a remote dataset 
        
        Uploads data to an existing remote project.
        It takes the project name and a single image (or directory) with images/videos to upload as parameters. 
        
        The `-e/--exclude` argument allows to indicate file extension/s to be ignored from the data_dir.
        
        For videos, the frame rate extraction rate can be specified by adding `--fps <frame_rate>`
        
        Supported extensions:
        -  Video files: [`.mp4`, `.bpm`, `.mov` formats].
        -  Image files [`.jpg`, `.jpeg`, `.png` formats].
        
        ```
        $ darwin upload example-dataset -r path/to/images
        Uploading: 100%|########################################################| 3/3 [00:01<00:00,  2.29it/s]
        ```
        
        Downloads a remote project, images and annotations, in the projects directory 
        (specified in the authentication process [default: `~/.darwin/projects`]).
        
        ```
        $ darwin pull example-project
        Pulling project example-project:latest
        Downloading: 100%|########################################################| 3/3 [00:03<00:00,  4.11it/s]
        ```
